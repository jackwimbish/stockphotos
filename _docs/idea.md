1. For AI Image Generation
Idea: "Slightly Off Stock Photos" (Unstock.ai)
The Pitch: Generate royalty-free stock images for your presentation that are 98% perfect, but contain one surreal, unsettling, or hilariously mundane detail that makes them completely unusable.

The Spoof Target: It pokes fun at the bland, soulless perfection of corporate stock photography and the weird artifacts that still plague AI image models.

How it Works: The user enters a generic stock photo prompt like "Diverse team collaborating in a modern office." The AI is prompted to fulfill the request but to always add a specific, strange detail.

Example Outputs:

Prompt: "Businesspeople shaking hands on a deal."

AI Image: A perfect stock photo, but the clasped hands are holding a single, sad-looking hot dog.

Prompt: "Woman laughing alone with a salad."

AI Image: A perfect stock photo, but all the lettuce leaves in the salad are tiny, screaming faces.
